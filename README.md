# PythonVproject PP3

PythonVproject is a Flu Vaccine Stock Tracking System designed to run on the render platform. This system is aimed at helping any medical practice that deals with vaccines to track their stock. The users can see their stock, record the deliveries and usage and know how much stock they have in date or expired. This system is aimed to help manage/trace orders and usage for reporting purposes like for example statistics to the health department.
